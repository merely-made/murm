//! Catch-up sync over any carrier, set up through the shared security gate.
//!
//! A [`SyncLane`] is `murm-sync`'s carrier-neutral [`StreamSession`] behind the
//! same setup discipline as Murm's session lane: one reservation from the
//! lane's [`SetupGate`] before any untrusted byte, one deadline through
//! establishment and security, and a stream whose setup budgets last until the
//! owner admits the peer. The owner picks the profile by the method called:
//! native iroh security on p2panda, Noise on every other ordered carrier. A
//! profile that fails is a refusal; nothing retries a weaker one.
//!
//! The lane admits on what the channel proved: it hands `allow` the
//! authenticated peer and runs the session only if that returns true. The
//! session then ingests each operation through the caller's `accept` closure
//! (see `murm_sync::processor_accept`), so a peer admitted here still cannot
//! write an operation the domain policy refuses.
//!
//! Addresses for Noise over TCP are explicit input. [`NoiseListener`] is not
//! used here: it handshakes on its own, outside the gate.
//!
//! [`NoiseListener`]: crate::noise::NoiseListener
